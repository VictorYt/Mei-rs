## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

First release: discovery of candidate mobile element insertion sites in
targeted capture and exome data.

### Added

- `mei-rs scan`, with global `--threads`, `-v` and `-q` options. (#1, #2)
- Inputs: indexed BAM or CRAM (with `--reference`), capture BED (plain or
  gzipped) padded with `--padding` and merged, `--region`. Inconsistent
  inputs fail early with a fix: contig naming (`chr1` vs `1`), missing index,
  reference contigs or lengths, empty region. (#5, #6, #7)
- Read filtering: secondary, supplementary, QC-fail and duplicate reads
  (`--include-duplicates`) and reads below `--min-mapq` do not anchor
  signals. (#8)
- Signal extraction, in parallel and deterministic: soft-clips with their
  poly(A/T) tail (`--min-clip-len`, `--min-clip-quality`, `--polya-min-len`,
  `--polya-min-frac`), unmapped mates, low-MAPQ mates, mates on another
  contig, and large inserts beyond a threshold estimated from the sample.
  (#9, #10, #11)
- Clustering into candidates (`--window`, `--min-support`), with the
  breakpoint, the junctions of both flanks, the TSD length and the strand.
  (#12)
- Capture filters: `probe_edge` (soft-clips stopping at probe edges) and
  `low_ratio` (`--min-signal-ratio`, against the local depth);
  `--keep-filtered`. (#13)
- Outputs: TSV, BED and JSON (`--format`, `--output`), specified in
  `docs/output.md`. (#14)
- Synthetic fixtures (a heterozygous Alu insertion with a TSD and a poly(A)
  tail, a negative sample, a probe-edge artefact) and end-to-end tests. (#4,
  #15)
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, tests on Linux and macOS, MSRV 1.91, audit. (#3)
